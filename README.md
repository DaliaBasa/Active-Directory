### Active Directory Fundamentals
###### Active Directory is a directory service made by Microsoft to give a solution to the IT infrastructure complexity within the growing numbers of users/devices in networks. Directory services allows an easy and quick storage, search and managment of resources within a network. The Active Directory works in a hierarchical way and allows the arrangement of resources based on DCs (Domain Controllers - databases), it is also a secutiry solution to vast networks.
###### Unlike Peer to Peer Networkv which is used in small networks, Active Directory is a centralised network managment, which uses databases that attain each user/device configuration.
##### Active Directory helps both IT/administrators and end users.
###### Users only need to login once and their files are stored in a repository which is accessible to other users from different domains/trees/forests.
###### Administrators/IT are enjoying the benefits of implementing group policies, having to make changes one time and push it for every computer in the domain, the same could be applied to security configurations. Storing vital information about the users in databases. The ability to make changes and apply them to domains are what makes Active Directory so keen.
