# Active Directory
Active Directory is the leading directory service solution made by Microsoft. It was first introduced in Windows 2000 Server edition as an implementation of X.500 directory.
Active Directory uses LDAP as its primary access protocol. Active Directory stores information about a variety of objects in the network such as user accounts, computer accounts, groups, and all related credential information used by Kerberos. 
Active Directory can be deployed in one of five forms: Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS), Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS), Active Directory Rights Management Services (AD RMS), Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS).
The repository will focus on AD DS as it’s the most common product of Active Directory.

Administrators/IT are enjoying the benefits of implementing group policies, having to make changes one time and push it for every computer in the domain, the same could be applied to security configurations. Storing vital information about the users in databases. The ability to make changes and apply them to domains are what makes Active Directory so keen.

# Active Directory Features

## Single Sign-On (SSO)
There are many applications that require authentications from the user, sometimes different authentication methods. This can be both time consuming for user and I.T and a security problem, a common security problem is having users writing down their passwords on notes around the office due to one too many passwords to remember for each application.
Single Sign-On as implied, requires the user to log in with a single user-ID and password for the whole session, Active Directory will provide the credentials needed for any further logins. Hence, the user won’t need to keep typing his credentials to get access.
